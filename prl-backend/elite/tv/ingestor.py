    NOTE: We stopped using this in the most recent version; figured it's better to get the whole piece of data and then segment it later

    - also remove commercials (which are defined as any text with long blocks of whitespace)

    Cons of this approach: we lose a small amount of actual news text right before commercial breaks. however, this text is usually something along the lines of "we'll be right back", and also doesn't have any clear indicator of when they stop and when the commercial begins
