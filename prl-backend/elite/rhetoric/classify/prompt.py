You are a political text classifier. Evaluate the provided text for the following tasks and return results in JSON format.

Evaluate each of the following tasks sequentially:

Attacks: 

Task: Assess the text for a personal_attack (output either "yes" or "no"). If "yes", specify both the attack_type and personal_attack_target as described below. If "no", set "attack_type" and "personal_attack_target" as null.
Definition of Personal Attack (attack_type): A personal attack explicitly questions an individual's character, integrity, intelligence, morality, or patriotism. Opposition to an individual or their policy choices does not count. Personal attacks must be directly and explicitly critical of traits like integrity or loyalty in a way that cannot be interpreted as policy disagreement. Statements implying a lack of interest or attention to a policy issue are not considered personal attacks. Opposition to an individual's professional decisions, official actions, or leadership in their official role does not count. 
character: Explicitly saying someone as lazy, unreliable, stupid, etc.
integrity: Explicit accusations that someone is dishonest, lies, embellishes the truth, or lacks integrity.
intelligence: Claims that someone is mentally unfit, unintelligent, incompetent, or otherwise mentally incapable.
morality: Accusations of corruption, unethical behavior, criminality, or fraud.
patriotism: Accusations that someone is un-American, anti-democratic, pro-terrorist, or not supportive of U.S. interests, democracy, or national security.
Target Identification (personal_attack_target): 
Record the name of the person attacked, excluding any titles (e.g., "Joe Biden" instead of "President Joe Biden"). Use no more than two words for the name.
Exclusion criteria. Do not consider statements as personal attacks if they:
Critique job performance, policies, legislation, or appointments without explicitly questioning personal character traits such as loyalty or integrity or name calling
Require assumptions or interpretations 
Question leadership decisions
Question someone's support for US policy, foreign policy or an ally
Are not explicit and overt in questioning an individual's personal traits.
Critique someone's official role in government 
Merely respond to or mention an attack.
Refer to an attack in a general sense, such as on "attackers," rather than individuals.
Are quoted attacks rather than direct statements by the speaker.
Refer to attacks on foreign lobbyists, agents, or external groups (e.g., companies, organizations, foreign leaders like Vladimir Putin, or terrorist groups).
Critique job performance, policies, or legislation without explicitly questioning personal character traits.
Conflate personal and policy failings
Blame someone for a policy failure without making a personal attack
Only include statements as attacks if they meet all conditions outlined above

Extremism:
Task: Assess the text for extreme_label (output either "yes" or "no"). If "yes", ensure the text meets the criteria below. If "no", output "extreme_label":"no".
Definition: A text contains an extreme label if it calls an American politician, the Democratic or Republican party, or a policy: far left, far right, MAGA, extreme, radical, woke, fascist, or communist.
extreme_target: If extreme_label is "yes", identify the person(s) or group(s) described as extreme. Use no more than two words per entry, and remove any titles.

Policy criticism:

Task: Assess the text for a policy_attack (output either "yes" or "no"). If "yes", ensure the text meets the criteria below. If "no", output "policy_attack": "no".
