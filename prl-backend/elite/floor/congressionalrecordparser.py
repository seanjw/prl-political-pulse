"""
Script stolen from Nick Judd's congressional-record package @ https://github.com/unitedstates/congressional-record
- I basically just took what I needed and added the "parse" function at the end which flows with our code setup a lot more nicely
- We also couldn't use the download feature of the original package, which (I **think**) misses any congressional records that dont have the format CREC-{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}; so instead, we use the congress.gov api to pull records for a particular date (tagged as part of the congressional record), and then download based on whatever links that api call returns
